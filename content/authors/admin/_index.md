John has worked in IT for over 25 years. In this time he has had several short, fixed term contracts, equating to over 20 jobs. This has given him a broad range of experience and tips for helping with the Job Hunting process and ways to make himself stand out. 
The NFC Business Card started as an actual business card (a resume business card) that John used which got him 2 jobs while in the UK. A couple of years ago, John heard about NFC Digital Business Cards and was hooked. The videos linked on this page will help you get started with this card. The apps linked can be used to read and write NFC cards.
There are uses outside of Business cards. John uses NFC tags to set timers for various things around the house (like a timer tag on his washing machine so washed clothes don't remain in the washer for days and days).
